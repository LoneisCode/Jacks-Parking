# Jacks-Parking

JacksParking is an application developed for Android platform. Jacksparking will provide information on available parking spaces on various lots of the Stephen F. Austin State University campus. The app also provides information such as lot types (residency, staff, all permit), lot availability (Ex. "This staff lot becomes all permit after 5 pm"), and other relevant information.

JacksParking will hopefully be extended to other platforms such as IOS in the future and offer more features.
